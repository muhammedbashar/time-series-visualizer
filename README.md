# Time Series Visualizer

This project visualizes time series data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

It analyzes daily page views of the freeCodeCamp forum from 2016 to 2019 and shows trends and seasonality using:

* Line chart

* Bar chart

* Box plots

The data is cleaned by removing outliers before visualization.

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.
